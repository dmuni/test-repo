Following is the procedure to build everything in dev and release

***************************IMPORTANT*******************
**********We should do this in the evening, because some of the processes might die during this build process**************
**********(esp. when 'mdate' is missing)****************

1. build every project in /home/mba/dev  - ( all C++ related stuff) using the following steps
	bld <project_name>
	cd /home/mba/dev/<project_name>
	make transmit
	bld_release <project_name>

There may be some projects that may not fit in this process. So, select each one and do them individually.
Always, start with "mba", because lot of other projects depend on that

1. Build the dev version of "mba"
	/home/mba/bin/bld mba

 Now transmit "mba" to rel, because all other projects depend on "rel" version of "mba"
	cd /home/mba/dev/mba
	make transmit
 Build the release verion of "mba"
	/home/mba/bin/bld_release mba

2. We have to build "mba" in "stable" also, otherwise they will be pointing to "current"
	/home/mba/bin/bld_stable mba

3. Repeat step 1 for drd, atr, ora, tck
	No need to repeat step 2, because we want all other projects to refer to current versions of "mba"
